# Dynamic Portfolio | A Next.js Project

## Introduction

This readme.md gives a description of the Dynamic Porfolio project built using **Next.js**. You'll find within this file : steps taken to create the project, a description of how the platforms and services used in the project communicate with each other and finally how to deploy the project on **Vercel**.

**The Dynamic Portfolio Idea** : The idea for this project was to create a portfolio website (static website) whose data is dynamically updated without the need for manual updates to the sites content. The content for the website can be sourced from the user's preferred social media platform profile and as well as from blog platforms. The end goal is to have a central place (a portfolio website) to share links, showcase the user's work and other form of content. 

With the traditional way of creating a portfolio website one would have to manually update content that is served on their portfolio website, what this project offers is an automated way to manage content updates to a deployed portfolio website. The possibilities for content integration with the portfolio website are many but for this project we'll limit it to one.

The main content of the portfolio website will be sourced from **LinkedIn**. LinkedIn as a platform allows it's users a great way to document and present their achievements. We'll be making use of this structured content by sourcing it and making use of it in the portfolio website.
